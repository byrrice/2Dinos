# 2Dinos
## My Personal Videogame Project

This is my personal videogame that I will be working on and updating throughout the summer. ? means might be implemented aka thinking about it. Transitioned to GitHub instead of using my blog to write about it. Wish I could private this repository tbh. 

## General Idea:

Currently working on dinosaur game - game where dinosaurs see different colored platforms and can switch from dinosaur to dinosaur midway through level with each having different abilities, 4 dinosaurs, rescue the different dinosaurs and gain access to them, maybe have secrets hidden, can only get through different dinosaurs, dinosaur combats black and white world villain is the other guy's world ,if you don't kill any of his friends,  then you unlock his version of playing ???

2 dinosaurs best friends (blue red), green is wife, yellow random npc

beginning cutscene blue and green approach ending hopping on platforms together, alternatively colored to reach the FRUIT?  kidnapped by non color man, then blue and red go on to rescue green, plays hurt sprite animation, falls from scene proceeds to fall down cliff side with sky in background

4 Dinosaurs are friends. Red and Blue are walking to meet their friends at the top of a cliff, alternating switching dinosaurs in order to mount the cliff. When they reach two friends green and yellow, cutscene is triggered. Green is kidnapped by colorless man, yellow is pushed off to "death". Blue and Red resolve to avenge their friend. There they realize that colorless man is simply robot manipulated by yellow. ending tbd.
